# Vitals

A calm sprint check-in tool. Engineers reflect after each sprint;
managers see warmth-first sentiment trends without surveillance vibes.

Built with **Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui**.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install      # or npm install / yarn
pnpm dev          # start dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

## The Sprint page

The Employee "Sprint" home — `pages/SprintView.tsx` — lays out one sprint's
reflection from highest-level signal down to actionable nudges:

1. **Hero check-in** — overall headline ("A heavy sprint", "A steady sprint"…),
   the employee's average score, team average, and trend vs. previous sprint.
   Background ribbon goes sage/clay/neutral based on score.
2. **Dimension grid** — six 5-step bars (Balance, Comms, Support, Collab,
   Workload, Satisfaction) with deltas vs. previous sprint.
3. **Ticket list** — what they worked on. Each row has an estimate-vs-actual
   bar with a tick at the estimate (no "you missed by 30%" red flags), plus an
   optional reflection note.
4. **Wins & pains** — color-blocked sage / clay panels. Wins are always paired
   with pains so the page never reads as judgmental.
5. **Prompts** — three open-ended questions to take into the next 1:1 or retro.

Try it across employees via the user switcher in the sidebar:
- **Maya (E001)** — steady, with workload at 2 for three sprints
- **Daniel (E002)** — improving; led his first incident
- **Priya (E003)** — strong & consistent
- **Lukas (E004)** — communication score stuck at 2
- **Aiko (E007)** — trending down across multiple dimensions

Use the sprint pager (top-right) to flip through S20–S24.

## Theme

Tailwind v4 config lives in `src/index.css` via `@theme inline`.
The Vitals palette overrides shadcn's tokens — `--primary` is **sage**,
`--destructive` is **clay** (softer than red — better for "pain" framing),
`--background` is a warm cream.

Custom tokens: `bg-sage`, `bg-sage-soft`, `bg-clay`, `bg-clay-soft`,
`bg-line-soft`, plus `text-sage` and `text-clay`.

## Adding shadcn components

Already configured for shadcn (`components.json` in repo root):

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add badge dialog dropdown-menu
```

## Next up

- **Check-in form** — the actual data entry point that feeds the Sprint page (six dimensions + wins/pains). Nothing writes to `mockData.ts` yet — Check-in is still a placeholder.
- **Patterns** view — sentiment trends across sprints
- **Retro prep** view — talking points synthesized from a check-in, for the actual retro meeting
- **History** view — browse past check-ins
- **Admin views** — Team overview is built; by-dimension, sprint-health, sentiment-trend, and settings are still placeholders
- **Team initialization (admin)** — admin sets each team's retro cadence: a start date plus weekly/bi-weekly/monthly recurrence. Employees should get notified a few days before their check-in window opens. No team-creation flow exists yet; this depends on it.
